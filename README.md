# Senior-Student-Manager
This Java program, SeniorStudentManager, functions as a student data management system.
It prompts the user to input the number of students and their details, such as ID, name, major, and GPA. The information is stored in a two-dimensional array, and the program can print the entered student data, check if a student with a specific name exists in the list, and identify the student with the highest GPA. The code employs methods for modularity, including inputStudentData() for data input, print() for displaying the student list, hasStudentWithName() for checking if a student exists in the list, and getStudentWithHighestGPA() for identifying the student with the highest GPA. The program uses loops for iteration and conditional statements for decision-making, enhancing its functionality and user interaction.
